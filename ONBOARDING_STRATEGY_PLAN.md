# 🚀 Bizo Seamless Onboarding & Intelligent Strategy Engine

This document outlines the blueprint for the next-generation onboarding experience for the Bizo Platform. It integrates multi-agent AI research, secure authentication, and autonomous setup into a frictionless user journey.

## 1. 🎛️ The "Seamless" Onboarding Wizard
A multi-step, dynamic flow in the Client Portal that adapts in real-time based on AI insights.

### Phase A: Discovery & Authorization
*   **Minimal Input:** User provides Business Name and Website URL.
*   **Auth Guard:** 
    *   Prompt for Gmail login if the user has a Google Business Profile (GMB).
    *   **Verification:** Ensure the authenticated Gmail has management access to the selected GMB.
    *   **Security:** Prevent unauthorized "claim" attempts to protect business reputations.
*   **AI Discovery Agent:** While the user is in the wizard, this agent performs a background "Digital Footprint" scan (Website, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, Google Maps).

### Phase B: Requirements & Constraints
*   **Goal Setting:** User selects primary objectives (Lead Gen, E-commerce Growth, Brand Awareness).
*   **Financial Scope:** User provides budget ranges.
*   **Presence Matrix:** A dropdown showing discovered online properties; user confirms which ones to manage.

### Phase C: The Intelligence Phase (Research & Strategy)
1.  **Research AI Team:** 
    *   *Search Expert:* Analyzes competitor rankings.
    *   *Content Analyst:* Evaluates current website copy and structure.
    *   *Sentiment Analyst:* Scans reviews and social mentions.
2.  **Strategy AI Team:** 
    *   *Senior Strategist:* Synthesizes research into a 3-month roadmap.
    *   *Budget Optimizer:* Allocates budget across channels (Ads, SEO, Social).
    *   *Execution Planner:* Generates specific workflows to be triggered.

## 2. 🤖 AI Agent Hierarchical Structure
Agents are organized into specialized "Crews" to handle different layers of the business.

| Team | Lead Agent | Tools / MCPs | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Senior Management** | Executive CEO Agent | Revenue Analytics, Growth Metrics | High-level goal alignment and ROI monitoring. |
| **Strategy & Phasing** | Chief Strategist | Market Research, Competitor API | Roadmap design and channel selection. |
| **Digital Marketing** | Growth Manager | GSC, Google Ads, Meta Ads | Campaign creation, keyword research, SEO. |
| **Development & Infra** | Technical Lead | SQL Admin, GitHub MCP, Dokploy | Integration setup, API connections, Wagtail config. |
| **Customer Support** | Support Supervisor | Ticketing System, AI Chat | User assistance during and after onboarding. |
| **Onboarding Monitor** | UX Guardian Agent | Session Analytics | Monitors onboarding friction and optimizes the flow. |

## 3. ⚙️ Execution & Workflow Integration
Once "Complete" is clicked, the platform triggers a cascade of Temporal workflows:
1.  **Channel Activation:** Automatically connects to selected APIs (Google, Meta, etc.).
2.  **Digital Presence Setup:** 
    *   Deploys/Configures CMS (Wagtail).
    *   Initializes SEO tracking.
    *   Sets up automated social media listening.
3.  **Initial Strategy Push:** The first set of tasks (e.g., "Fix 404 errors", "Update GMB Hours") appears in the user's task board.

## 4. 🛠️ Admin Suggestion & Platform Growth
A separate loop for platform administrators to keep the service suite evolving.
*   **Scout Agent:** Identifies missing business niches or tool requirements.
*   **Suggestion Engine:** Populates the Admin Dashboard with "Recommended New Connectors" or "Workflow Optimizations".
*   **Marketplace Growth:** AI suggests new profit-sharing opportunities with partners.
