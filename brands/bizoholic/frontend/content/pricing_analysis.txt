## 📉 Operational Costs (Fixed)

These costs are shared across all users and decrease per-unit as you scale.

1.  **VPS (KVM2 -> KVM4 Upgrade):** ~$20/mo
2.  **Marketing / CAC:**
    *   Estimated CAC (Organic/Content): **$50 - $100**
    *   Payback Period (Solo): **2 months**
    *   Payback Period (Pro): **<1 month**

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

1.  **Use GPT-4o-mini for "Solo":** It's 30x cheaper and sufficient for basic social posts. Reserve GPT-4o for Pro/Agency.
2.  **SEO API Caching:** Critical. If a user requests an audit for "nike.com", cache it for 7 days. Do not fetch fresh data every time.
3.  **Bring-Your-Own-Key (BYOK):** For the "Agency" tier, consider allowing them to plug in their own Semrush/OpenAI keys for a discount, removing your risk cap.

## 🚀 Conclusion

The proposed pricing **($49 / $149 / $499)** covers your costs 8-10x over.
*   **Best Margin:** Solo Plan (Volume play).
*   **Best Absolute Profit:** Agency Plan ($400+ profit/user).
*   **Sweet Spot:** Pro Plan ($120 profit/user).

You are safe to proceed with these tiers.
