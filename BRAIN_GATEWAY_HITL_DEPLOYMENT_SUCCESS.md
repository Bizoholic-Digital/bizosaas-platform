## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Enable HITL for New Feature Testing
```bash
# You're testing a new lead processing algorithm
# Enable HITL to review AI decisions before they execute
curl -X POST "http://194.238.16.237:8001/api/brain/hitl/workflows/lead_processing/toggle?enabled=true"

# Monitor decisions
curl http://194.238.16.237:8001/api/brain/hitl/decisions/pending

# After reviewing for a week and confidence is high, disable HITL
curl -X POST "http://194.238.16.237:8001/api/brain/hitl/workflows/lead_processing/toggle?enabled=false"
```

### Scenario 2: Adjust Confidence for More Autonomy
```bash
# Campaign optimization AI is performing well
# Lower the threshold so it acts more autonomously
curl -X PUT "http://194.238.16.237:8001/api/brain/hitl/workflows/campaign_optimization/confidence?threshold=0.65"
```

### Scenario 3: Increase Oversight for Critical Operations
```bash
# Payment processing is critical
# Increase threshold so almost all decisions need approval
curl -X PUT "http://194.238.16.237:8001/api/brain/hitl/workflows/payment_processing/confidence?threshold=0.98"

# Change to supervised mode (all decisions require approval)
curl -X PUT "http://194.238.16.237:8001/api/brain/hitl/workflows/payment_processing/autonomy?level=supervised"
```

## 🔐 Security Notes

### Current Configuration
- External access: ✅ Enabled (Port 8001)
- Redis: ✅ Connected (local VPS)
- Authentication: ⚠️ **Not yet implemented** (super admin only endpoints)

### Recommended Security Enhancements
1. **Add Authentication**: Implement JWT-based auth for HITL endpoints
2. **Role-Based Access**: Restrict toggle/approval to super admin role
3. **API Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of HITL endpoints
4. **SSL/TLS**: Use HTTPS for external access (via Traefik/Nginx)
5. **Audit Logging**: Enhanced logging of all HITL decisions
