# Frontend Deployment Error - thrillring-gaming Not Found

**Error**: `The service thrillring-gaming not found in the compose`
**File**: `dokploy-frontend-staging-local.yml`
**Status**: Error found and fix documented

---

## Problem

Dokploy is looking for a service called `thrillring-gaming` that doesn't exist in the compose file.

The compose file only contains **5 services**:
1. client-portal
2. bizoholic-frontend
3. coreldove-frontend
4. business-directory-frontend
5. admin-dashboard

**ThrillRing Gaming is NOT included** because:
- We don't have a working local image for it yet
- It needs to be built separately
- It's on our "deploy later" list (part of the remaining 10 services)

---

## Root Cause

One of two things:
1. **Dokploy has old cached compose configuration** that includes thrillring-gaming
2. **The compose path in Dokploy settings** is pointing to a different file that includes thrillring-gaming

---

## Solution

### Option 1: Update Dokploy Compose Path (Recommended)

In Dokploy dashboard:
1. Go to `bizosaas_frontend_staging` project
2. Click on `frontend_services` compose
3. Check "Compose Path" setting - it should be:
   ```
   ./dokploy-frontend-staging-local.yml
   ```
4. If it's different, update it
5. Click "Save"
6. Click "Deploy"

### Option 2: Clear Dokploy Cache

```bash
# On VPS
ssh root@194.238.16.237
cd /etc/dokploy/compose/frontend-services-a89ci2/
rm -rf code/
# Then redeploy from Dokploy dashboard
```

### Option 3: Add Dummy thrillring-gaming Service (Quick Fix)

Add this to the compose file temporarily:

```yaml
  # PLACEHOLDER - Will be replaced later
  thrillring-gaming:
    image: alpine:latest
    command: sleep infinity
    container_name: bizosaas-thrillring-gaming-placeholder
    restart: "no"
    networks:
      - dokploy-network
```

This creates a placeholder that won't interfere with deployment.

## Correct Compose File Content

The file at `./dokploy-frontend-staging-local.yml` should contain:

```yaml
services:
  client-portal:
    image: bizosaas-client-portal:latest
    container_name: bizosaas-client-portal-staging
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://bizosaas-brain-staging:8001
    networks:
      - dokploy-network
    restart: unless-stopped

  bizoholic-frontend:
    image: bizosaas-bizoholic-frontend:latest
    container_name: bizosaas-bizoholic-frontend-staging
    ports:
      - "3001:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://bizosaas-brain-staging:8001
    networks:
      - dokploy-network
    restart: unless-stopped

  coreldove-frontend:
    image: bizosaas-coreldove-frontend:latest
    container_name: bizosaas-coreldove-frontend-staging
    ports:
      - "3002:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://bizosaas-brain-staging:8001
    networks:
      - dokploy-network
    restart: unless-stopped

  business-directory-frontend:
    image: bizosaas-business-directory:latest
    container_name: bizosaas-business-directory-frontend-staging
    ports:
      - "3003:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://bizosaas-brain-staging:8001
    networks:
      - dokploy-network
    restart: unless-stopped

  admin-dashboard:
    image: bizosaas-bizosaas-admin:latest
    container_name: bizosaas-admin-dashboard-staging
    ports:
      - "3005:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://bizosaas-brain-staging:8001
    networks:
      - dokploy-network
    restart: unless-stopped

networks:
  dokploy-network:
    external: true
```

**No thrillring-gaming service** - that's correct!

---

## Next Steps

**Please check in Dokploy dashboard:**
1. Navigate to: `bizosaas_frontend_staging` â†’ `frontend_services`
2. Check the "Compose Path" setting
3. Verify it's set to: `./dokploy-frontend-staging-local.yml`
4. If not, update it and save
5. Click "Deploy" again

**Then let me know:**
- What was the Compose Path set to?
- Did changing it fix the error?
- Or do we need to use Option 2 (clear cache) or Option 3 (add placeholder)?

## ThrillRing Gaming - Deploy Later

ThrillRing Gaming is part of the "remaining 10 services" that need to be built and deployed after we get these 5 working. It requires:
1. Building the Docker image locally
2. Transferring to VPS
3. Adding to a separate compose file or this one

**For now, focus on deploying the 5 services we have ready.**
