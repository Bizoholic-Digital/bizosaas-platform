# Unhealthy Services - Root Cause Analysis

**Date**: October 15, 2025, 5:25 PM
**Status**: 6/23 services unhealthy (74% healthy)
**Objective**: Achieve 100% healthy status

---

## Summary

After analyzing all 6 unhealthy services, I found:

- **3 services are actually HEALTHY** (false alarms - health checks misconfigured)
- **2 services have port/config issues** (easy fixes)
- **1 service has build issue** (requires Docker image rebuild)

---

## ✅ FALSE ALARMS (Actually Healthy - 3 services)

### 1. Saleor E-commerce (Port 8000) ✅ ACTUALLY HEALTHY
**Status**: Reports "unhealthy" but working perfectly
**Evidence**:
- Logs show Gunicorn started successfully with 4 workers
- Health endpoint returns HTTP 200
- GraphQL API is operational

**Root Cause**: Health check in compose file expects `/health/` but Saleor uses `/graphql/`

**Fix**: Update health check endpoint in compose file
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8000/graphql/"]
```

**Priority**: Low (service is working, just health check cosmetic issue)

---

### 2. Client Portal (Port 3000) ✅ ACTUALLY HEALTHY
**Status**: Reports "unhealthy" but working perfectly
**Evidence**:
- Next.js started successfully in 1053ms
- Returns HTTP 200 on port 3000
- No errors in logs

**Root Cause**: Health check misconfigured or expecting different endpoint

**Fix**: Remove health check or update to correct endpoint

**Priority**: Low (service is working, just health check cosmetic issue)

---

### 3. ThrillRing Gaming (Port 3005) ✅ ACTUALLY HEALTHY
**Status**: Reports "connection failed" but working perfectly
**Evidence**:
- Next.js started successfully in 1299ms
- Port bindings correct: `3000/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:3005`
- Logs show "Ready in 1299ms"

**Root Cause**: Initial health check timing issue or Docker network delay

**Fix**: None needed - service is operational

**Priority**: Low (cosmetic issue only)

---

## ⚠️ CONFIGURATION ISSUES (Easy Fixes - 2 services)

### 4. Auth Service (Port 8006) ⚠️ PORT MISMATCH
**Status**: Running on wrong internal port
**Evidence**:
- Logs show: `Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8007`
- Environment variable: `PORT=8006`
- External port binding: `8006/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:8006`
- Health check fails because container listens on 8007 but env says 8006

**Root Cause**: Container ignores PORT environment variable and uses hardcoded port 8007

**Fix Option 1**: Update compose file to use port 8007
```yaml
auth-service:
  ports:
    - "8006:8007"  # External:Internal
  environment:
    - PORT=8007  # Match actual port
```

**Fix Option 2**: Rebuild container to respect PORT=8006 environment variable

**Priority**: Medium (service unreachable due to port mismatch)

---

### 5. QuantTrade Frontend (Port 3012) ⚠️ NGINX MISCONFIGURATION
**Status**: Nginx running but not proxying correctly
**Evidence**:
- Logs show Nginx started successfully
- Returns HTTP 000 (connection failure) instead of proxying to app
- Nginx config may be missing upstream configuration

**Root Cause**: Nginx not configured to proxy to Next.js app, or Next.js not running behind Nginx

**Fix**: Check if this should be Next.js container or Nginx needs upstream config
```bash
docker exec bizosaas-quanttrade-frontend-staging cat /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
```

**Priority**: Medium (service not accessible)

---

## 🔴 BUILD ISSUES (Requires Image Rebuild - 1 service)

### 6. Bizoholic Frontend (Port 3001) 🔴 INCOMPLETE BUILD
**Status**: Critical - Returns HTTP 500 on all requests
**Evidence**:
```
Module parse failed: Unexpected character '@' (1:0)
> @tailwind base;

[Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/app/.next/required-server-files.json']
```

**Root Cause**: Docker image built without complete Next.js standalone output
- Missing `.next/required-server-files.json`
- TailwindCSS not being processed (@tailwind directives failing)
- Incomplete `next build` during Docker build

**Fix**: Rebuild Docker image with proper Next.js build
```dockerfile
# Dockerfile must include:
RUN npm run build
# And copy standalone output:
COPY --from=builder /app/.next/standalone ./
COPY --from=builder /app/.next/static ./.next/static
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
```

**Priority**: HIGH (main website not accessible)

## 📊 Priority Fix Order

### Immediate (Production Impact)
1. **Bizoholic Frontend** - Rebuild image with complete Next.js build (HIGH)

### Short Term (Fix This Week)
2. **Auth Service** - Update port configuration (MEDIUM)
3. **QuantTrade Frontend** - Fix Nginx config or switch to Next.js container (MEDIUM)

### Low Priority (Cosmetic)
4. **Saleor** - Update health check endpoint (LOW)
5. **Client Portal** - Fix health check (LOW)
6. **ThrillRing Gaming** - Already working, no fix needed (LOW)

---

## 🎯 Achievable Status

**Current**: 17/23 healthy (74%)
**After easy fixes**: 19/23 healthy (83%) - Fix Auth + QuantTrade
**After all fixes**: 23/23 healthy (100%) - Rebuild Bizoholic

**Estimated Time**:
- Auth Service fix: 5 minutes
- QuantTrade fix: 10 minutes
- Bizoholic rebuild: 30-60 minutes
- **Total**: 45-75 minutes to 100% healthy

## 🔧 Recommended Actions

### Option 1: Quick Wins First (Recommended)
1. Fix Auth Service port (5 min)
2. Investigate QuantTrade Nginx (10 min)
3. Update health checks for Saleor/Client Portal (5 min)
4. Rebuild Bizoholic Frontend (30-60 min)

### Option 2: Critical First
1. Rebuild Bizoholic Frontend immediately (30-60 min)
2. Fix Auth + QuantTrade afterward (15 min)
3. Health check updates last (5 min)
