# Docker Compose Path Strategy - BizOSaaS Platform

**Date**: October 15, 2025
**Status**: ✅ Recommended Strategy

---

## 🎯 Recommended Approach: Local Pre-Built Images

### Current Status
You have **working local images** already built and tested on your WSL2 environment. These images are the **fastest path to deployment** right now.

### Why This Approach?

#### ✅ **Advantages**
1. **Images Already Built** - No need to wait for GitHub Actions
2. **Tested Locally** - You know these images work
3. **Fast Deployment** - Just pull and run on VPS
4. **No CI/CD Setup Required** - Works immediately

#### ⚠️ **Trade-offs**
1. Manual image transfer (one-time setup)
2. Need to rebuild locally for changes
3. Better suited for single developer workflow

---

## 📋 Recommended Compose Files

### **Infrastructure Layer**
```bash
File: dokploy-infrastructure-staging-with-superset-build.yml
Strategy: Builds Superset from GitHub, uses official images for others
Services: 6 (PostgreSQL, Redis, Vault, Temporal Server, Temporal UI, Superset)
```

**Why This One?**
- ✅ Temporal Server included (workflow orchestration)
- ✅ Superset builds from your GitHub repo
- ✅ Standard images for PostgreSQL, Redis, Vault
- ✅ Complete infrastructure in one file

### **Backend Layer**
```bash
File: dokploy-backend-staging-local.yml
Strategy: Uses pre-built local images
Services: 10 (Brain Gateway, AI Agents, Auth, Wagtail, Saleor, Django CRM, etc.)
```

**Why This One?**
- ✅ References local images (bizosaas-brain-gateway:latest, etc.)
- ✅ Proper environment variables configured
- ✅ Correct network (dokploy-network)
- ✅ Health checks included

### **Frontend Layer**
```bash
File: dokploy-frontend-staging-local.yml
Strategy: Uses pre-built local images
Services: 7 (Bizoholic, ThrillRing, CorelDove, Client Portal, Admin, Directory, QuantTrade)
```

**Why This One?**
- ✅ References local images (bizosaas-bizoholic-frontend:latest, etc.)
- ✅ Correct ports mapped
- ✅ Routes through Brain Gateway
- ✅ Missing ThrillRing? Can be added

---

## 🚀 Deployment Order

### **Phase 1: Infrastructure First**
```bash
cd /root/bizosaas-platform
docker-compose -f dokploy-infrastructure-staging-with-superset-build.yml up -d

# Wait 30-60 seconds for databases to initialize
docker-compose -f dokploy-infrastructure-staging-with-superset-build.yml ps
```

### **Phase 2: Backend Services**
```bash
# Deploy backend (depends on infrastructure)
docker-compose -f dokploy-backend-staging-local.yml up -d

# Wait 20-30 seconds for services to start
docker logs bizosaas-brain-staging --tail 50
```

### **Phase 3: Frontend Services**
```bash
# Deploy frontend (depends on backend, especially Brain Gateway)
docker-compose -f dokploy-frontend-staging-local.yml up -d

# Check all services
docker ps --format 'table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}'
```

## 🔄 Alternative: GitHub + GHCR Strategy (Future)

### When to Migrate?

**Migrate to GitHub + GHCR when:**
1. ✅ You have multiple developers
2. ✅ Need automated builds on every push
3. ✅ Want faster deployment (pre-built images)
4. ✅ Need production-grade CI/CD

### What's Required?
1. GitHub Actions workflow (✅ Already created)
2. Fix service paths in workflow
3. Push images to GHCR
4. Update compose files to use `ghcr.io/bizoholic-digital/bizosaas-*:staging`

## 📊 Compose File Comparison

| File | Strategy | When to Use |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `dokploy-*-local.yml` | Local images | ✅ **NOW** - Fastest deployment |
| `dokploy-*-ghcr.yml` | GHCR images | ⏳ After GitHub Actions setup |
| `dokploy-*-github.yml` | Build from GitHub | ⏳ Alternative (slower builds) |
| `dokploy-staging-complete.yml` | GHCR (all-in-one) | ⏳ After migration |

## 🎯 Current Recommendation

### **For Immediate Deployment (Today)**

#### 1. **Use These Files:**
- Infrastructure: `dokploy-infrastructure-staging-with-superset-build.yml`
- Backend: `dokploy-backend-staging-local.yml`
- Frontend: `dokploy-frontend-staging-local.yml`

#### 2. **Deployment Command:**
```bash
cd ~/projects/bizoholic/bizosaas-platform
./deploy-and-cleanup-vps.sh
```

#### 3. **What It Does:**
- ✅ Connects to VPS (194.238.16.237)
- ✅ Pulls latest code from GitHub
- ✅ Cleans up unused Docker resources
- ✅ Deploys all 23 services in correct order
- ✅ Verifies deployment
- ✅ Tests Brain Gateway

---

## 🔮 Migration Path (Future)

### **Phase 1: Current (Local Images)**
```
Local Build → Save/Transfer → VPS Deploy
```

### **Phase 2: GitHub + GHCR (Recommended Next)**
```
Local Push → GitHub Actions → GHCR → VPS Pull & Deploy
```

### **Phase 3: Full CI/CD**
```
Git Push → Auto-Test → Auto-Build → Auto-Deploy Staging → Manual Promote Production
```

## 📝 Notes

### **Missing Services in Local Compose Files**

#### ThrillRing Gaming
The `dokploy-frontend-staging-local.yml` doesn't include ThrillRing. Add:
```yaml
thrillring-gaming:
  image: bizosaas-thrillring-gaming:latest
  container_name: bizosaas-thrillring-gaming-staging
  ports:
    - "3005:3000"
  environment:
    - NODE_ENV=production
    - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://bizosaas-brain-staging:8001
  networks:
    - dokploy-network
  restart: unless-stopped
```

#### QuantTrade Frontend
May also need to be added if missing.
