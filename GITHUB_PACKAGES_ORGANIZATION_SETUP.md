# GitHub Packages Organization Setup

**Issue:** Cannot publish `@bizosaas/*` packages because @bizosaas organization doesn't exist
**Solution:** Two options available

---

## Option 1: Create @bizosaas GitHub Organization (RECOMMENDED)

### Why Organization is Better:
- ✅ Team collaboration (multiple developers)
- ✅ Professional branding (@bizosaas/package-name)
- ✅ Access control and permissions
- ✅ Separate from personal account
- ✅ Allows multiple repositories under organization

### Steps to Create:

1. **Create GitHub Organization:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/organizations/new
   - Organization name: `bizosaas`
   - Contact email: bizoholic.digital@gmail.com
   - Plan: Free (sufficient for private packages)

2. **Add User as Owner:**
   - Settings → People → Invite members
   - Add: alagirirajesh (your GitHub username)
   - Role: Owner

3. **Enable GitHub Packages:**
   - Organization Settings → Packages
   - Enable package visibility settings
   - Configure access controls

4. **Update Token Scope:**
   - Current token belongs to user `alagirirajesh`
   - Either: Use same token (works if you're org owner)
   - Or: Create new org-level token

5. **Transfer Repository:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/Bizoholic-Digital/bizosaas-platform/settings
   - Scroll to "Danger Zone"
   - Click "Transfer ownership"
   - Transfer to: bizosaas organization
   - Confirm transfer

## Option 2: Use Personal Scope (QUICK FIX)

### Why Personal Scope:
- ✅ Works immediately (no org setup needed)
- ✅ Good for solo development
- ❌ Less professional branding
- ❌ Harder to add collaborators later
- ❌ Mixed with personal packages

### Steps to Implement:

Change package scope from `@bizosaas` to `@alagirirajesh`:

```bash
# Update all 6 packages
for package in auth ui-components api-client hooks utils animated-components; do
  sed -i 's/"@bizosaas\//"@alagirirajesh\//g' packages/$package/package.json
done

# Update .npmrc
sed -i 's/@bizosaas/@alagirirajesh/g' ~/.npmrc

# Re-publish
./scripts/publish-all-packages.sh
```

## Recommendation

### For BizOSaaS Platform: **Create Organization**

Reasons:
1. This is a **multi-service platform** with 22+ services
2. You may want to add **team members** in the future
3. **Professional branding** matters for enterprise clients
4. Easier to manage **access control** across services
5. Can have **multiple repositories** under one umbrella

### Implementation Plan:

**Phase 1: Quick Fix (Today)**
- Use personal scope `@alagirirajesh` to get packages working
- This unblocks development immediately

**Phase 2: Organization Migration (This Week)**
- Create `@bizosaas` organization
- Transfer repository ownership
- Re-publish packages under `@bizosaas` scope
- Update service dependencies

## Current Status

**Token:** ✅ Valid for user `alagirirajesh`
**Packages:** ❌ Trying to publish to non-existent `@bizosaas` org
**Error:** `403 Forbidden - Permission not_found: owner not found`

**Next Action:**
Choose option and proceed:
- Option 1: Create organization (takes 10 minutes)
- Option 2: Use personal scope (takes 2 minutes)
