## Technical Implementation Details

### Agent Architecture Patterns

**HierarchicalAgent Class:**
```python
class HierarchicalAgent:
    def __init__(self, agent_id: str, role: AgentRole, config: Dict[str, Any]):
        self.agent_id = agent_id
        self.role = role
        self.subordinates = []
        self.supervisor = None
        self.tools = []
        self.performance_metrics = AgentPerformanceMetrics(agent_id, role.value)
        self.delegation_rules = config.get('delegation_rules', {})
        
    def find_best_subordinate(self, task_type: str, requirements: Dict[str, Any]):
        # Intelligent agent selection based on performance and capabilities
        
    def can_delegate(self, task_type: str) -> bool:
        # Delegation capability assessment
```

**Advanced Tool Implementation:**
```python
class AdvancedAgentTool(BaseTool):
    def __init__(self, name: str, description: str, func: Callable, 
                 cache_enabled: bool = True, performance_tracking: bool = True):
        # Performance monitoring and caching capabilities
        
    def _run(self, *args, **kwargs) -> str:
        # Execution with performance tracking and caching
        
    def get_performance_metrics(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Real-time performance metrics
```

### Workflow Orchestration Patterns

**Multi-Project Workflow Execution:**
```python
async def execute_cross_project_workflow(self, workflow_config: Dict[str, Any]):
    results = {}
    for project_config in workflow_config.get("projects", []):
        project_id = project_config["project_id"]
        crew_name = project_config["crew_name"]
        project_workflow = project_config["workflow"]
        
        result = await self.execute_project_workflow(
            project_id, crew_name, project_workflow
        )
        results[f"{project_id}_{crew_name}"] = result
    
    return {"status": "completed", "cross_project_results": results}
```

**Performance Monitoring Integration:**
```python
class WorkflowPerformanceMonitor:
    async def collect_metrics(self, agents: Dict[str, HierarchicalAgent]):
        # Real-time metric collection
        
    def analyze_trends(self, agent_id: str, hours: int = 24):
        # Performance trend analysis
        
    def _generate_recommendations(self, metrics: List[Dict[str, Any]]):
        # AI-powered optimization recommendations
```
