## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Three-Tier Agent Hierarchy

1. **Supervisor Agents**
   - Master Business Supervisor (coordinates all operations)
   - Domain Supervisors (CRM, E-commerce, Analytics, Billing, CMS, Integrations)
   - Handle complex task delegation and crew coordination

2. **Specialist Agents**
   - Domain-specific intelligent processing
   - CRM: Lead scoring, customer segmentation specialists
   - E-commerce: Inventory optimization, product recommendation specialists
   - Analytics: Report generation, insights specialists
   - Each domain has 2-3 specialized agents

3. **Worker Agents**
   - Operational task execution
   - Data processing, API calls, specific operations
   - Each domain has 2-3 worker agents for different task types

### Smart Delegation Engine

The system automatically determines the best execution strategy:

- **Direct DB/API** (Simple CRUD): < 1 second execution
- **Single Agent** (Moderate AI tasks): 15-30 seconds execution  
- **Multi-Agent** (Complex coordination): 60-120 seconds execution
- **Crew Workflow** (Expert orchestration): 120+ seconds execution
