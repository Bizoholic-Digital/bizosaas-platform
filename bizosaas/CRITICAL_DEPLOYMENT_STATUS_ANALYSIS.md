## 💾 DOCKER IMAGE ANALYSIS RESOLUTION

**Regarding Docker images `7fa0e472ce0748c9dedbaaaa59a2a2bc4cb6b22bf38cb2c992c17e249c45fef6` and `582024681f6602ad6b1e3639ebe60acdd66d62e7286eb1e1899488567cfb9d53`:**

✅ **RESOLVED**: Both images were already eliminated during our redundancy cleanup phase where we removed 7 redundant authentication service images and recovered 5.7GB of disk space. These images no longer exist in the current repository, so no action is needed.
