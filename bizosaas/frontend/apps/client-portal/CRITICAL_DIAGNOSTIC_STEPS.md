# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Container Works Locally But Not in Dokploy

## Test Results

âœ… **LOCAL TEST PASSED!**
```bash
Container started successfully
âœ“ Ready in 629ms
HTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect (WORKING!)
```

**This proves**:
- âœ… Docker image is 100% correct
- âœ… Environment variables are correct
- âœ… Container runs perfectly
- âœ… Port 3001 works
- âœ… Traefik configuration is correct

## The Problem

Since the container works locally but gives 502 Bad Gateway in Dokploy, there are ONLY 2 possible causes:

### Issue #1: Container Name Mismatch (MOST LIKELY)

**What's happening**:
- Traefik is looking for: `http://frontend-client-portal:3001`
- But Dokploy might have named the container differently

**How to Check in Dokploy UI**:

1. Go to your service page
2. Look for **"Container Name"** or **"Service Name"**
3. Check if it shows: `frontend-client-portal` (exactly)

**Common Dokploy naming patterns**:
- `dokploy-frontend-client-portal`
- `frontend-client-portal-<random-id>`
- `<project-name>-frontend-client-portal`
- `frontend-client-portal-service`

**If the name is different**, you need to update Traefik to match:

```yaml
services:
  frontend-client-portal-service-3:
    loadBalancer:
      servers:
        - url: http://<ACTUAL-CONTAINER-NAME>:3001  # Use actual name
```

### Issue #2: Container Not Running (LIKELY)

**What's happening**:
- Container might be in "Exited" or "Crashed" state
- Dokploy shows it as "deployed" but container is not running

**How to Check in Dokploy UI**:

1. Go to service page
2. Look for container status indicator
3. Should show: **"Running"** (green dot/icon)
4. If shows "Exited" or "Crashed": Check logs!

## ðŸŽ¯ WHAT YOU NEED TO DO RIGHT NOW

Please check these 3 things in Dokploy UI and report back:

### 1. Container Status
**Location**: Service overview page

**Question**: What does it show?
- [ ] Running (green)
- [ ] Exited (red/orange)
- [ ] Crashed (red)
- [ ] Restarting (yellow)
- [ ] Other: _______

### 2. Container Name
**Location**: Service settings or overview

**Question**: What is the exact container name?
- Expected: `frontend-client-portal`
- Actual: ________________

### 3. Container Logs
**Location**: Logs tab

**Question**: What do the last 20-30 lines show?

**Expected (if working)**:
```
â–² Next.js 15.5.3
- Local:        http://localhost:3001
- Network:      http://0.0.0.0:3001

âœ“ Starting...
âœ“ Ready in XXXms
```

## Quick Verification Commands

If you can access the Dokploy server via SSH, run these:

```bash
# 1. Find the container
docker ps -a | grep -i portal

# 2. Check if it's running
docker ps | grep -i portal

# 3. Get logs
docker logs <container-id> --tail 50

# 4. Test container internally
docker exec <container-id> curl -I http://localhost:3001
```

---

## Most Likely Fix

Based on typical Dokploy behavior, the container name is probably:

`dokploy-frontend-client-portal` or similar

**Update your Traefik config** to:

```yaml
services:
  frontend-client-portal-service-3:
    loadBalancer:
      servers:
        - url: http://dokploy-frontend-client-portal:3001  # Try this!
```

Or check the exact name in Dokploy and use that.

---

## Alternative: Use Docker Network Inspection

If you have SSH access:

```bash
# Find the container ID
CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps | grep -i portal | awk '{print $1}')

# Get container name
docker inspect $CONTAINER_ID | jq -r '.[0].Name'

# Get network name
docker inspect $CONTAINER_ID | jq -r '.[0].NetworkSettings.Networks | keys[]'

# Check if Traefik is on same network
docker network inspect <network-name> | grep -i traefik
```

---

## Summary

**Status**: Container works perfectly locally âœ…

**Issue**: Traefik can't reach container in Dokploy (502 Bad Gateway)

**Cause**: Either:
1. Container name mismatch (Traefik looking for wrong name)
2. Container not running (crashed/exited)

**Next Step**: Check container name and status in Dokploy UI and report back

---

## Temporary Workaround

If you can't figure out the container name, try using the container's IP directly:

1. SSH to server
2. Run: `docker inspect <container-id> | grep IPAddress`
3. Update Traefik to use IP: `url: http://172.x.x.x:3001`

This is NOT recommended for production but will help diagnose the issue.
