# SOLUTION FOUND - Container Naming Pattern

## Bizoholic Frontend Traefik Config

```yaml
services:
  frontend-bizoholic-frontend-service-2:
    loadBalancer:
      servers:
        - url: http://frontend-bizoholic-frontend:3001  # ← This pattern!
```

**Naming Pattern**: `frontend-<service-name>:<port>`

## Client Portal Should Use

Based on the pattern, Client Portal container name should be:

```yaml
services:
  frontend-client-portal-service-3:
    loadBalancer:
      servers:
        - url: http://frontend-client-portal:3001  # ← Not 8EqZXZKYTLiPqTkLF2l4J
```

## The Issue

You tried `http://frontend-client-portal:3001` initially and it didn't work.
Then you changed to `http://8EqZXZKYTLiPqTkLF2l4J:3001` and it still doesn't work.

This means the **Docker container name in Dokploy is different** from what we expect.

## Possible Reasons

### Reason 1: App Name Configuration

In Dokploy, check the **"App Name"** field in the General tab.

- Bizoholic Frontend app name: `frontend-bizoholic-frontend`
- Client Portal app name: Should be `frontend-client-portal` but might be different

### Reason 2: Service Name Mismatch

The service might be named differently in Dokploy.

**Check in Dokploy General Tab**:
- Look for "Name" or "App Name" field
- This determines the Docker container name

### Reason 3: Network Name

Container might be using a different network name within Dokploy.

## Quick Fix: Check App Name in Dokploy

1. Go to Client Portal General tab: https://dk4.bizoholic.com/dashboard/project/VM7SbnKYZKl6nxKYey4Xn/environment/w9JtT6e9Glus_8cjWIEWc/services/application/8EqZXZKYTLiPqTkLF2l4J?tab=general

2. Look for these fields:
   - **Name**: ________________
   - **App Name**: ________________
   - **Service Name**: ________________

3. The container name will be based on one of these values.

## Container Name Possibilities

Based on Dokploy behavior, try these variations:

### Variation 1: Original Pattern (Already Tried)
```yaml
url: http://frontend-client-portal:3001
```
**Status**: ❌ Didn't work

### Variation 2: App ID (Already Tried)
```yaml
url: http://8EqZXZKYTLiPqTkLF2l4J:3001
```
**Status**: ❌ Didn't work

### Variation 3: With Dash Separator
```yaml
url: http://frontend-client-portal-3:3001
```

### Variation 4: With Service Suffix
```yaml
url: http://frontend-client-portal-service:3001
```

### Variation 5: Different Service Name
If the app was named differently in Dokploy (e.g., "client-portal" instead of "frontend-client-portal"):
```yaml
url: http://client-portal:3001
```

### Variation 6: Check Exact Name
The field in Dokploy General tab might show: "Client Portal" or "clientportal" etc.
```yaml
url: http://clientportal:3001
url: http://client-portal:3001
```

## Docker Network Issue

Another possibility: Container is not on the same Docker network as Traefik.

### Check Network Settings

1. In Client Portal service, go to **Advanced** or **Network** tab
2. Look for "Docker Network" or "Network Mode"
3. Compare with Bizoholic Frontend's network settings
4. They should be on the same network (usually `dokploy-network` or similar)

---

## The Real Container Name

Since we know:
- ✅ Container is running (logs show it)
- ✅ Container is healthy (Ready in 219ms)
- ✅ Port 3001 is correct
- ❌ Traefik can't reach it

The ONLY issue is the container name mismatch.

**We need to find the EXACT Docker container name.**

---

## Action Plan

### Step 1: Check App Name in Dokploy UI

Go to General tab and look for the "Name" or "App Name" field. Screenshot it if needed.

### Step 2: Try Container Name Variations

Update Traefik URL to match the app name exactly. For example:
- If app name shows "Client Portal" → try `client-portal:3001`
- If app name shows "clientportal" → try `clientportal:3001`
- If app name shows "portal" → try `portal:3001`

### Step 3: Check Network Configuration

Verify both services are on the same Docker network.

### Step 4: Last Resort - Use Container IP

If nothing works, we can temporarily use the container's IP address:

```yaml
url: http://172.x.x.x:3001
```

This is not ideal but will verify everything else is working.

## What I Need From You

Please check the Dokploy General tab and tell me:

1. **App Name field**: What does it show? ________________
2. **Name field**: What does it show? ________________
3. **Any other "name" related fields**: ________________

With this information, I can tell you the exact container name to use in Traefik!
