# Implementation Task Plan - Bizoholic Ecosystem Workflow Automation

## Executive Overview

This implementation plan outlines the strategic deployment of 2000+ N8N workflow templates from the awesome-n8n-templates repository across the Bizoholic ecosystem (Bizoholic Marketing, BizosaAS Platform, CoreLDove E-commerce) with enhanced Temporal workflow orchestration and FastAPICrewAI integration.

## Current Implementation Status

### Infrastructure Readiness ✅
```yaml
Existing_Services:
  k3s_cluster: "bizosaas-dev namespace - 13 active microservices"
  postgresql: "Multi-tenant with pgvector for AI embeddings"
  dragonfly_cache: "High-performance Redis alternative"
  n8n_workflow_engine: "Port 30004 - Visual automation ready"
  temporal_orchestration: "Docker compose configuration available"
  crewai_agents: "AI agent framework deployed"
  
Service_Status:
  backend_api: "✅ Port 30081 - Fully operational"
  ai_orchestrator: "✅ Port 30320 - Agent coordination working"
  marketing_ai: "✅ Port 30307 - Strategy generation active"
  analytics_ai: "✅ Port 30308 - SEO analysis operational"
