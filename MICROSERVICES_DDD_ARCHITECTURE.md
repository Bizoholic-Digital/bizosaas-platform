# BizOSaaS Microservices Architecture with DDD Principles

**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Status:** CORRECTED ARCHITECTURE
**Previous Error:** Attempted monorepo approach - INCORRECT
**Correct Approach:** Containerized microservices with shared npm packages

---

## Core Architectural Principles

### 1. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Each service represents a bounded context
- Services are independently deployable
- Each service has its own database/data store
- Services communicate via APIs and message queues

### 2. Microservices Architecture
- **Independent deployment** - Each service can be deployed without affecting others
- **Technology agnostic** - Services can use different tech stacks
- **Isolated failures** - One service failure doesn't cascade
- **Independent scaling** - Scale services based on their specific load

### 3. Shared Components via npm Packages
- Reduce code redundancy through shared libraries
- Packages published to GitHub Packages (npm registry)
- Each microservice installs packages like any other npm dependency
- **NO monorepo** - Services are completely independent

---

## BizOSaaS Service Architecture

### Frontend Microservices (7 Services)
Each frontend is a **separate microservice** with its own:
- Git repository directory
- Docker container
- Deployment configuration
- Domain/subdomain
- Independent CI/CD pipeline

```
1. Bizoholic Frontend       ‚Üí bizoholic.com
2. CoreLDove Frontend        ‚Üí coreldove.com
3. ThrillRing Frontend       ‚Üí thrillring.com
4. Client Portal             ‚Üí portal.bizosaas.com
5. Business Directory        ‚Üí directory.bizosaas.com
6. Analytics Dashboard       ‚Üí analytics.bizosaas.com
7. Admin Dashboard           ‚Üí admin.bizosaas.com
```

### Backend Microservices (15+ Services)
```
1. Auth Service              ‚Üí auth.bizosaas.com
2. AI Agents Service         ‚Üí ai.bizosaas.com
3. Brain Gateway             ‚Üí gateway.bizosaas.com
4. Wagtail CMS               ‚Üí cms.bizosaas.com
5. Django CRM                ‚Üí crm.bizosaas.com
6. Amazon Sourcing           ‚Üí sourcing.bizosaas.com
7. Business Directory API    ‚Üí directory-api.bizosaas.com
8. CoreLDove Backend         ‚Üí api.coreldove.com
9. Payment Service           ‚Üí payments.bizosaas.com
10. Notification Service     ‚Üí notifications.bizosaas.com
... and more
```

## Shared Packages Strategy

### Package Publishing Workflow

```bash
# 1. Build the package
cd packages/auth
npm run build

# 2. Publish to GitHub Packages
npm publish

# 3. Services install from npm registry
cd ../../bizosaas/misc/services/bizoholic-frontend
npm install @bizosaas/auth@latest
```

### Package Versioning
- Use semantic versioning (semver)
- Breaking changes: Major version bump
- New features: Minor version bump
- Bug fixes: Patch version bump

### Current Shared Packages (6 Total)

#### 1. @bizosaas/auth
**Purpose:** Authentication, authorization, session management
**Used by:** All 7 frontends
**Contents:**
- AuthContext and AuthProvider
- useAuth hook
- Next.js middleware

## Docker Build Strategy

### CORRECT Approach: Microservice Dockerfiles

Each service has its own Dockerfile that:
1. Uses multi-stage build for optimization
2. Installs dependencies from npm registry
3. Builds only that service
4. Creates minimal production image

#### Example: Bizoholic Frontend Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Dependencies
FROM node:18-alpine AS deps
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files
COPY package*.json ./
COPY .npmrc ./

# Install dependencies (including @bizosaas packages from GitHub Packages)
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Stage 2: Builder
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
COPY .npmrc ./
RUN npm ci

COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 3: Runner
FROM node:18-alpine AS runner
WORKDIR /app

ENV NODE_ENV production

COPY --from=builder /app/next.config.js ./
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
COPY --from=builder /app/.next/standalone ./
COPY --from=builder /app/.next/static ./.next/static

EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

### Key Points:
- **NO workspace copying** - Each service is self-contained
- **npm registry packages** - Shared packages come from GitHub Packages
- **Independent builds** - Each service builds without knowing about others
- **Minimal images** - Only production dependencies included

---

## Deployment Architecture

### Independent Deployment Pipeline

```
Developer Push ‚Üí GitHub ‚Üí GitHub Actions ‚Üí Build Docker Image ‚Üí
Push to GHCR ‚Üí Dokploy ‚Üí Deploy to K3s ‚Üí Service Running
```

### Each Service:
1. Has its own GitHub Actions workflow
2. Builds its own Docker image
3. Pushes to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
4. Deployed independently via Dokploy
5. Scales independently based on load

### Service Communication

```
Frontend (bizoholic.com)
    ‚Üì HTTP/REST
Auth Service (auth.bizosaas.com)
    ‚Üì JWT Validation
    ‚Üì
Backend Services
    ‚Üì Message Queue (RabbitMQ/Redis)
    ‚Üì
AI Agents / Background Jobs
```

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] 6 shared packages created and working
- [x] npm workspaces configured for LOCAL development
- [x] Bizoholic frontend using shared packages
- [x] Local build successful (5.2s)
- [x] Code reduction: 93% (150 lines ‚Üí 10 lines)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CORRECTION NEEDED
- [ ] Remove monorepo Dockerfile
- [ ] Configure GitHub Packages authentication
- [ ] Publish all 6 packages to GitHub Packages
- [ ] Update service Dockerfiles to use published packages
- [ ] Update deployment documentation

### üéØ Next Actions
1. Set up .npmrc for GitHub Packages authentication
2. Publish packages: @bizosaas/auth, ui-components, api-client, hooks, utils, animated-components
3. Update Bizoholic package.json to use published versions
4. Create proper microservice Dockerfile for Bizoholic
5. Test independent Docker build
6. Deploy to Dokploy
7. Repeat for remaining 6 frontends

---

## Development Workflow

### Local Development (npm workspaces)
```bash
# Work on shared packages locally
cd /home/alagiri/projects/bizosaas-platform
npm install  # Links all workspace packages

# Make changes to shared package
cd packages/auth
# ... make changes ...
npm run build

# Changes immediately available to services
cd ../../bizosaas/misc/services/bizoholic-frontend
npm run dev  # Uses local workspace version
```

### Production Build (published packages)
```bash
# Publish updated package
cd packages/auth
npm version patch  # or minor/major
npm run build
npm publish

# Services pull from registry
cd ../../bizosaas/misc/services/bizoholic-frontend
npm update @bizosaas/auth
docker build -t bizoholic-frontend .
```

- Parallel deployment possible
- Fast build times (no copying entire monorepo)

### 3. Reduced Redundancy
- Shared packages eliminate duplicate code
- 93% code reduction across services
- Single source of truth for common functionality

### 4. DDD Compliance
- Each service represents a bounded context
- Clear boundaries between domains
- Independent data stores per service

### 5. Scalability
- Scale services independently
- Add new services without affecting existing ones
- Easy to move services to different infrastructure

## Comparison: Monorepo vs Microservices

| Aspect | ‚ùå Monorepo | ‚úÖ Microservices + npm |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Build** | Copy all packages into each service | Install from registry |
| **Deployment** | Coupled deployments | Independent deployments |
| **CI/CD** | Slow (builds everything) | Fast (builds only service) |
| **Docker Image** | Large (includes all code) | Small (only service code) |
| **DDD Compliance** | Poor (tight coupling) | Excellent (loose coupling) |
| **Repository** | Single repo required | Can split into multiple repos |
| **Team Autonomy** | Limited | Full autonomy per service |
| **Scaling** | Scale everything together | Scale services independently |

---

## Conclusion

The **correct architecture** for BizOSaaS is:

1. **Containerized microservices** following DDD principles
2. **Shared npm packages** published to GitHub Packages
3. **Independent deployments** via Dokploy/K3s
4. **npm workspaces** for LOCAL development only
5. **No monorepo builds** - each service builds independently

This approach gives us:
- ‚úÖ 93% code reduction through shared packages
- ‚úÖ True microservices independence
- ‚úÖ DDD compliance with bounded contexts
- ‚úÖ Fast, efficient builds and deployments
- ‚úÖ Easy scaling and maintenance
