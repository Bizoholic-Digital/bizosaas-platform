## Action Required

Since you've updated the frontend compose file in Dokploy but containers aren't starting, there could be a few issues:

### Possibility 1: Dokploy Needs Manual Trigger
The compose file was updated but deployment wasn't triggered.

**Solution**: Click "Deploy" button in Dokploy frontend project

### Possibility 2: Missing Business Directory Frontend Image
The business-directory-frontend image might not exist or have a different name.

**Solution**: Check local image name
```bash
docker images | grep business-directory
```

### Possibility 3: Compose File Path Issue
The compose file might be referencing GitHub instead of local images.

**Solution**: Verify compose file uses:
```yaml
services:
  client-portal:
    image: bizosaas-client-portal:latest  # Local image
    # NOT build: context: https://github.com/...
```

---

## Next Steps

### Step 1: Verify Business Directory Frontend Image
```bash
# Check if image exists locally
docker images | grep "business.*directory.*frontend"

# If it exists with different name, tag it correctly
docker tag <current-name> bizosaas-business-directory-frontend:latest
```

### Step 2: Transfer Missing Image (if needed)
```bash
# Save and transfer
docker save bizosaas-business-directory-frontend:latest | gzip > business-directory-frontend.tar.gz
scp business-directory-frontend.tar.gz root@194.238.16.237:/tmp/
ssh root@194.238.16.237 "gunzip -c /tmp/business-directory-frontend.tar.gz | docker load"
```

### Step 3: Verify Dokploy Compose File
The compose file should look like this:
```yaml
services:
  client-portal:
    image: bizosaas-client-portal:latest
    container_name: bizosaas-client-portal-staging
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://bizosaas-brain-staging:8001
    networks:
      - dokploy-network
    restart: unless-stopped

  # ... similar for other 4 services
```

### Step 4: Trigger Deployment
- Go to Dokploy Dashboard
- Navigate to bizosaas_frontend_staging project
- Click "Deploy" button
- Monitor logs for errors

---

## Expected Container Names

Once deployed, these containers should appear:
```
bizosaas-client-portal-staging (port 3000)
bizosaas-bizoholic-frontend-staging (port 3001)
bizosaas-coreldove-frontend-staging (port 3002)
bizosaas-business-directory-frontend-staging (port 3003)
bizosaas-admin-dashboard-staging (port 3005)
```

---

## Monitoring Commands

### Check if containers are starting:
```bash
ssh root@194.238.16.237 'watch -n 2 docker ps -a | grep staging'
```

### Check deployment logs:
```bash
ssh root@194.238.16.237 'docker logs bizosaas-client-portal-staging -f'
```

### Verify all services:
```bash
ssh root@194.238.16.237 'docker ps --filter "name=bizosaas" | wc -l'
# Should show 19 (6 infra + 7 backend + 5 frontend + 1 header)
```

## Issue: Why Frontend Isn't Deploying

Since you manually deployed backend and it worked, but frontend isn't deploying, the most likely causes are:

1. **Dokploy hasn't been triggered** for frontend project
2. **Compose file syntax error** in frontend configuration
3. **Missing business-directory-frontend image**
4. **Port conflicts** (ports 3000-3005 might be in use)

**Recommendation**:
Please trigger the frontend deployment manually in Dokploy dashboard, and let me know what errors appear in the deployment logs.
