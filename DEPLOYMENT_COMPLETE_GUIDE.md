## 🔧 Deployment Progress Tracking

### **Automated Monitoring**

The deployment is being monitored automatically. To check progress:

```bash
# View monitoring output
bash /home/alagiri/projects/bizoholic/monitor-and-complete.sh

# Quick status check
bash /home/alagiri/projects/bizoholic/bizosaas-platform/final-verification.sh
```

### **Manual Monitoring**

You can also monitor via Dokploy UI:
- URL: https://dk.bizoholic.com
- Navigate to: Projects → Backend Services / Frontend Services
- View build logs in real-time

---

## 🌐 Domain Configuration (To Do After Builds Complete)

### **DNS Configuration** (Step 1)

Add these A records in your DNS provider:

```
Record                         Type   Value
-------------------------------------------------------------
stg.bizoholic.com              A      194.238.16.237
stg.marketing.bizoholic.com    A      194.238.16.237
stg.admin.bizoholic.com        A      194.238.16.237
stg.directory.bizoholic.com    A      194.238.16.237
stg.coreldove.com              A      194.238.16.237
stg.thrillring.com             A      194.238.16.237
```

### **Dokploy Domain Configuration** (Step 2)

Once all 22 services are running, configure domains:

```bash
# Run the interactive configuration guide
bash /home/alagiri/projects/bizoholic/configure-domains.sh
```

This script will guide you through:
1. DNS record verification
2. Dokploy domain setup for each service
3. SSL certificate configuration (Let's Encrypt)
4. Final verification

### **Manual Configuration** (Alternative)

For each frontend service in Dokploy:

1. Go to: Projects → Frontend Services → [Service Name]
2. Click: Domains tab
3. Add domain:
   - Domain: (from table above)
   - Port: (from table above)
   - HTTPS: Enabled (Let's Encrypt)
4. Save and wait for SSL certificate generation (2-5 minutes)

## 🚨 If Issues Occur

### **Build Failures**
1. Check Dokploy build logs
2. Verify Docker build contexts are correct
3. Check for missing dependencies
4. Redeploy affected service

### **Port Conflicts**
- All ports are unique (no conflicts expected)
- Verify with: `bash final-verification.sh`

### **Domain Issues**
1. Verify DNS records propagated (use `dig` or `nslookup`)
2. Check Traefik routing in Dokploy
3. Regenerate SSL certificates if needed

### **Service Health Checks Failing**
1. Check service logs in Dokploy
2. Verify environment variables
3. Check database connectivity
4. Verify Redis connectivity

---

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Wait for monitoring script** to complete (shows when 22/22 services are running)
2. **Configure DNS records** (add 6 A records)
3. **Run domain configuration script**:
   ```bash
   bash /home/alagiri/projects/bizoholic/configure-domains.sh
   ```
4. **Verify all services** are accessible via HTTPS
5. **Test basic functionality** of each application
