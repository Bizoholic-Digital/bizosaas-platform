## Post-Deployment Verification

### Automated Verification
Run the verification script:
```bash
./verify-infrastructure-deployment.sh
```

### Manual Verification

#### Test PostgreSQL
```bash
# From local machine or VPS
PGPASSWORD="BizOSaaS2025!StagingDB" psql -h 194.238.16.237 -p 5432 -U admin -d bizosaas_staging -c "SELECT version();"
```

#### Test Redis
```bash
redis-cli -h 194.238.16.237 -p 6379 ping
# Expected: PONG
```

#### Test Vault
```bash
curl http://194.238.16.237:8200/v1/sys/health
# Expected: JSON response with initialized status
```

#### Test Temporal UI
```bash
curl -I http://194.238.16.237:8082
# Expected: HTTP 200 OK
```

#### Test Temporal Integration
```bash
curl http://194.238.16.237:8009/health
# Expected: {"status": "healthy"}
```

## Troubleshooting Checklist

### If PostgreSQL fails to start:
- [ ] Check logs for error messages
- [ ] Verify port 5432 is not in use
- [ ] Check environment variables are correct
- [ ] Verify volume permissions
- [ ] Try container restart

### If Redis fails to start:
- [ ] Check port 6379 availability
- [ ] Verify volume mount
- [ ] Check Redis logs
- [ ] Try container restart

### If Vault fails to start:
- [ ] Check IPC_LOCK capability
- [ ] Verify port 8200 availability
- [ ] Check Vault logs
- [ ] Verify development mode settings

### If Temporal Server fails to start:
- [ ] Verify PostgreSQL is running and accessible
- [ ] Check database credentials
- [ ] Verify temporal_staging database exists
- [ ] Check Temporal Server logs
- [ ] Ensure auto-setup completed

### If Temporal UI fails to start:
- [ ] Verify Temporal Server is running
- [ ] Check TEMPORAL_ADDRESS environment variable
- [ ] Verify port 8082 availability
- [ ] Check UI logs

### If Temporal Integration fails to build/start:
- [ ] Verify GitHub repository is accessible
- [ ] Check Dockerfile path is correct
- [ ] Verify all dependencies are running
- [ ] Check build logs
- [ ] Verify environment variables

## Success Criteria

All items below must be checked for successful deployment:

- [ ] All 6 containers show "Running" status
- [ ] All health checks show "Healthy" status
- [ ] No error messages in any container logs
- [ ] Temporal UI loads successfully in browser
- [ ] Vault UI loads successfully in browser
- [ ] All databases created in PostgreSQL
- [ ] Redis responds to PING commands
- [ ] Network connectivity between containers verified
- [ ] Volumes persist data across container restarts
- [ ] Resource usage is within acceptable limits

---

## Next Steps After Successful Deployment

- [ ] Document connection details for backend services
- [ ] Save Vault root token securely
- [ ] Test database migrations
- [ ] Configure monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Prepare for backend services deployment
- [ ] Update project documentation

---

## Rollback Plan

If deployment fails and cannot be fixed:

1. [ ] Stop all containers
2. [ ] Remove failed application
3. [ ] Delete volumes if needed (data loss warning!)
4. [ ] Review logs and errors
5. [ ] Fix configuration issues
6. [ ] Retry deployment

---

## Important Notes

- **Critical**: PostgreSQL must be running before Temporal Server starts
- **Security**: Change all default passwords for production
- **Backup**: Set up regular backups of data volumes
- **Monitoring**: Configure resource monitoring for containers
- **Scaling**: Infrastructure can be scaled independently of applications
